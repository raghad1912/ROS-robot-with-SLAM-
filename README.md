# Use another ROS robot with SLAM 

### i choose this project https://github.com/georgeerol/MapAWorldWithSlamAndACustomRobot, and try to execute it .

### this project is about implement a SLAM RTAB map and simulate custom robot in kitchen world .

### introduction 
#### In Localization, a robot is provided to map its environment. The robot has access to its movement and sensor data and uses them to estimate its pose. However, there are many applications where there isn't a known map because the area is unexplored or because the surrounding change often; therefore the map is not up to date. In such case, the robot will have to construct a map, and this leads to robotic mapping.
